1. When does parsing need to take place and what does it need to start properly?

Parsing takes place when a command is inputed. It needs a command to start properly (a String to parse) which either executes or throws an exception.

Complex commands (such as square) need a database that already has the instruction implemented. The other way is to create a new datebase can be made to represent a complex command.

2. What is the result of parsing and who receives it?

The result of parsing is a series of instructions for the Turtle to undergo. The instructions are then sent to the Controller which understands the command and then operates on the Model.

3. When are errors detected and how are they reported?

Errors are detected in the Interpretor and are reported via a Popup.

4. What do commands know, when do they know it, and how do they get it?
As of now, it seems as if there are two types of commands. Simple commands contain a direction and magnitude, which includes moving in one direction for a length, or turning for a length.

Complex commands, on the other hand, contain a type. The type needs to be known by the Interpretor, meaning an instruction has already been entered.

5. How is the GUI updated after a command has completed execution?
The turtle is moved to the new location, with or without a trace.

General Design:

*Model*:
2D Polar Grid Class
Turtle Class

*View*:
Grid Display (likely GridView or a General Pane)
Turtle Display (image)
Database Display (That lists commands)
Interprator Display (That takes in commands)

*Controller*
Interprator (goes from Input to Model)
Drawer (goes from Model to View)
Error Checker

Workflow for a Instruction.
In Dialogue Box, user inputs Command.
Command goes to Error Checker to either create Pop Up or pass through
If passed, command goes to Interpretaor which maps the String to the series of changes.
Interpretaor makes the changes to the Turtle/Grid Model.
Drawer is called, which then adds lines (or not, if desired) to the View. Turtle location is updated.
